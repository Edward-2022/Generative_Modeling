# Generative_Modeling

This repository is the accompanying code we utilized for our project during the 2021 Emory REU in Data Science.  Our code is a revised edition of the Convex Potential Flows code that can be found here: https://github.com/CW-Huang/CP-Flow

Our addition involved implementing a pre-conditioned conjugate gradient method for faster approximation of the log determinant of a Hessian matrix due to the benefit of less iterations required by our method compared to the standard conjugate gradient method.
